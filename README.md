# amUrtayantra
a formless machine to explore the question: what is livecoding?
## ay0
The amUrtayantra (sanskrit: formless machine) is a register and array (tape) based virtual machine that controls the audio buffer using a subset of printable ascii characters (its alphabet). It is being built as an effort to understand and experience the essence of livecoding.
During the course of performance the machine must be programmed as it is running (hence live); there is no start/stop/reload as it endlessly loops over the tape/array. No presets yet.
It is built on openframeworks, which uses the RtAudio library, so no JACK. Future plans include a baremetal version for the raspberry pi computer.
